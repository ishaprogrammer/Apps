# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! In this Python program, you'll control a snake and try to eat the food while avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself. Let's see how long you can survive!üêçüéÆ

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Execute the `main.py` script in your terminal or IDE.

2. **Game Rules:**
   - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
   - The snake grows longer each time it eats the food.
   - The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

3. **Scoring:**
   - Each time the snake eats the food, your score increases.
   - The high score is saved and displayed.

### **`foodclass.py`**:
   - This file contains the `food` class, which represents the food item that the snake needs to eat.
   - The `food` class handles the creation of food at random positions on the screen.

### **`scoreboard.py`**:
   - In this file, you'll find the `Scoreboard` class responsible for keeping track of the player's score.
   - The `Scoreboard` class initializes the score, updates it during gameplay, and displays it on the screen.

### **`snakeclass.py`**:
   - This file defines the `snake` class, which represents the snake controlled by the player.
   - The `snake` class handles the snake's movement, growth, and collision detection.
   
4. **Example:**
   - Run the program and guide the snake to eat the food.
   - Be careful not to crash into the walls or yourself!
