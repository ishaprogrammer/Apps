Welcome to the Ping-Pong game! In this Python program, you'll play a classic game of ping-pong against the computer. Get ready to test your reflexes!

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Execute the `main.py` script in your terminal or IDE.

2. **Controls:**
   - The right paddle (controlled by the computer) moves up with the "Up" arrow key and down with the "Down" arrow key.
   - The left paddle (controlled by you) moves up with the "w" key and down with the "s" key.
   - The ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom walls.
   - Earn points by hitting the ball with your paddle.

### **`ballclass.py`**:
   - This file defines the `Ball` class, which represents the ball in the ping-pong game.
   - The `Ball` class handles the ball's movement, bouncing off walls and paddles, and resetting its position.

### **`paddleclass.py`**:
   - In this file, you'll find the `Paddle` class, which represents the left and right paddles controlled by the players.
   - The `Paddle` class defines methods for moving the paddles up and down.

### **`scoreboard.py`**:
   - This file contains the `Scoreboard` class responsible for keeping track of the game's score.
   - The `Scoreboard` class initializes the score, updates it during gameplay, and displays it on the screen.

3. **Example:**
   - Run the program and play against the computer.
   - The game ends when one of the paddles misses the ball.
